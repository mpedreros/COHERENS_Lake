# COHERENS_Lake
Setups of COHERENS application to a Southamerican lake

We applied the hydrodynamic module of the COHERENS model to a Chilean lake: Lanalhue. It is a coastal, small-sized lake in Southamerica.

In this repository you can find the different setups for the experiments we ran in order to find an adequate parametrization for Lanalhue Lake. Setups can be changed with four main files: defruns, 
Usrdef_Surface_Data.f90 , Usrdef_Model.f90  and Usrdef_Time_Series.f90. 

Codes in Google Earth Engine (GEE) utilized to extract Landsat 8 satellite dataset can be found in the following link:
